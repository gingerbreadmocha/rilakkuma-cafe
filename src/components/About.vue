        <h1>About Rilakkuma's Cafe : A History</h1>
        <div class="description">
        <p>One day, Rilakkuma's Butler, Kaoru, received a notice saying that their current apartment building was going to be torn down. It was at that moment, that Rilakkuma had made the biggest decision of his life. He was going to find a part-time job. But due to his super huge cotton, he had trouble retaining his jobs. :( He ate dango while he was making it, and was relieved from his position. He then decided to work at a construction site, but since he had no muscle, he couldn't lift anything. Thus, he was given the........ sad notice of termination. He then was offered a job as an assistant chef to peel vegetables, but since he was pounds++, the head chef got angry at him when he took up too much space. He decided to become kuma-nabe. But Kaoru-san was so forgiving, Rilakkuma was moved. He decided to open up a cafe in order to earn enough mesos to buy the apartment building and save it from destruction.</p>
